        <p>Good news! i just spent 2 hours learning, and I know the basics of css <strong>and </strong>html. I have a <strong>SIX DAY HOLIDAY</strong>, and i'm going to use it. When I get back to school, im going to be the best at html. My computer teacher is a very bad teacher and i dont like how we're learning it. <strong>You can't learn html from a <em>book</em></strong>.</p>

        <p>Bad news. It turns out we haven't done the same things I learned. Instead of the <em>em</em> tag, we have learned the <i>i</i> tag, and instead of the <em>strong</em> tag, we have learned the <em>b</em> tag. And instead of the text tags I learned in css, we have learned a bunch of other tags you can use in html. Also, we had to <strong>WRITE DOWN CODE, IN A BOOK!!</strong> I dont see how we're going to learn if we're writing our code in a book, even when we have a perfectly functioning computer lab!</p>
